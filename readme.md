# Fishing Assistant – Australian Edition 🇦🇺

Customised version of [bairnhard/fishing_assistant](https://github.com/bairnhard/fishing_assistant)
with support for Australian fish species, tide, wind and seasonal scoring.

# 🎣 Fishing Assistant for Home Assistant

**Fishing Assistant** is a custom integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) that predicts optimal fishing times for your favorite lakes, rivers, ponds, or reservoirs — based on weather, solunar theory, and environmental factors.

> _"Is today a good day to go fishing?"_  
Let Home Assistant tell you. 🐟

You can add multiple fishing spots via the UI or YAML:

### UI (Preferred)
Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Fishing Assistant**  
Enter:
- Name (e.g., “Ammersee”)
- Coordinates or Home Assistant Zone
- Fish species (comma-separated)
- Body type (lake, river, pond, reservoir)

## 🐟 Scoring System

Each day is given a **score from 0 to 10**, where:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0     | ❌ Stay home. Tie flies instead. |
| 3     | 😐 Meh — maybe go if you're bored. |
| 6     | 👍 Good conditions. Worth a shot. |
| 8     | 🔥 Great — pack the rods! |
| 10    | 🚨 CALL IN SICK. Risk the divorce. |

### Factors considered:

- ✅ **Air temperature** (proxy for water temp)
- 🌥 **Cloud cover**
- 💨 **Wind speed**
- 🌧 **Precipitation**
- 🧭 **Barometric pressure trend**
- 🌅 **Twilight boost** (1h around sunrise/sunset)
- 🌑 **Moon phase**
- 🌗 **Solunar periods** (transit, underfoot, rise/set)
- 🌊 **Water body type** (affects weightings)

- Tweak fish profiles and weights to better match local experience.
